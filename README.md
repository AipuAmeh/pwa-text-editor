# PWA-Text-Editor
## Description

This week's challenge was to edit an already functioning website and turn it into a progressive web application, (PWA). The highlight of this week was webpack and its various plugins to make this website fully functional offline. 
## Installation

To install this application, you need webpack and the webpack command line interface (cli). Once those are installed, there are many other plugins you can utilize. These include: HTML webpack plugin, a PWA Manifest, an Inject Manifest, and a CSS extract plugin. You will also need babel to assist with compiling your code.
